## Lite Server

The `lite-server` does not automatically rebuild your TypeScript files when they change. It only refreshes the browser when HTML or JavaScript files change.

To have your TypeScript files automatically recompile when you make changes, you can use `tsc --watch` command. This command starts the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the compiler watches for file changes and recompiles when it sees them.

Then, you can run `npm run watch` in a separate terminal to start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode.

However, this will not refresh your browser when your TypeScript files are recompiled. To do this, you can use a tool like `concurrently` to run both `lite-server` and `tsc --watch` at the same time, and have `lite-server` refresh the browser whenever your compiled JavaScript files change.

Once installed this Update your start script to run both commands:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"tsc --watch\" \"lite-server\""
}
```

Now, when you run `npm start`, it will start both the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and lite-server. When you make changes to your TypeScript files, they will be automatically recompiled, and `lite-server` will refresh your browser.
